In JavaScript, primitive data types are data types that are not objects and have no methods. Examples include numbers, strings, booleans, null, and undefined.

Non-primitive data types are data types that are objects and have methods. Examples include arrays and functions.

------------------oops concepts --------------
1)a class is a blueprint in which we can create an object using single class we can create multiple objects
2)object is a real world physical entity anything which is physically present   it contains state and behaviours state is nothing but properties behaviour is nothing but an methods 



3)inheritance 

inheritance is the process of acquiring properties from superclass to the subclass

we can achieve inheritance by using extends keyword in a subclass

by using inheritance we can achieve code reusability and code redundancy
ex ----
a child inherits its characteristics and behaviours of its parent is a real world example of inheritance


4)polymorphism 

different forms of doing the same activity is nothing  but polymorphism

there are two types of polymorphism 
compile time polymorphism  and runtime polymorphism

1)
Compile-time polymorphism, also known as static polymorphism or method overloading,which is taken care by the compiler 

2)run time polymorphism : 
Run-time polymorphism, also known as dynamic polymorphism which   uses method overriding

5)Abstraction : hiding the internal process and showing a functionality to the user 
ex : atm machine 

6)encapsulation is a process of wrapping up of Private data members along with public handler methods
ex : capsule and class


in left join we get unmatched records of left table along with matched records

syntax : select columnname 
         from tablename1 LEFTOUTERJOIN tablename2
         ON tablename1.columnname= tablename2.columnname

in right join we get unmatched records of right table along with matched records

syntax : select columnname 
         from tablename1 RIGHTOUTERJOIN tablename2
         ON tablename1.columnname= tablename2.columnname

INNER  JOIN 

we use inner join to obtain only the matched records from a Tables

syntax select cloumnname
       from tablename1  INNERJOIN tablename2
       ON tablename1.columnname= tablename2.columnname
