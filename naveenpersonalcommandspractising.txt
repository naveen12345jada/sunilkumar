  // Place your global snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and
  // description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope
  // is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is
  // used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders.
  // Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "Print to console": {
    "scope": "javascript,typescript",
    "prefix": "cl",
    "body": ["console.log();"],
    "description": "Log output to console"
  }

The @import rule also supports media queries, so you can allow the import to be media-dependent.
